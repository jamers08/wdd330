        <h2>Mobile First Notes</h2>
        <p>Always design for the smallest device first!
            The PC took 30 years to reach its peak. Within two years of the iPhone launch, there was already a rise in mobile and tablet usage. In 2011, the pc market plateaued while the mobile devices skyrocketed in popularity.
            We went from 1-2 devices per household, to 2+ devices per person per household.
            Mobile first may be more time consuming for a full rebuild, it provides the best experience across multiple devices, addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth, and is future friendly and ready for growth.
            Q: Is this mostly geared toward those (like me) who learned to code before the rise of mobile devices, or is this an issue that is common regardless of how familiar someone is to coding?
            People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. Don’t listen to what they say, watch what they are doing and find a way to fill their needs as simply as possible.
            1. Be there. To help move someone along their decision journey and deepen their loyalty.
            2. Be useful. Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn’t satisfy their needs.
            3. Be quick. It’s not just about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well.
            **Recall the boarding pass. 5 steps to delete vs. 0 steps to delete, as it is already removed/archived from their list.
            Reachability matters!
            75% of people rely on their thumbs, 49% use a one-handed grip.
            Networks matter
            Just because I have a high-speed network doesn’t mean that everyone has the same access.
                4G – 126 million, 1.77% penetration
                3G – 1.7 billion, 24.55% penetration
            Speed Matters
                Reduce image usage throughout sites/apps
                SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth
            Optimized and Minify css and js files
            GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data
                Q: When did Webfonts become a thing? Is this the new standard?
            What can we do to make software better?
            Menus and sub navigation should be at the bottom of the page. Think about Facebook’s recent update for reachability.
            Hamburger button is not intuitive. The word MENU wrapped in a border saw a 20% increase in clicks.
            
            Forms
            You can only fit so much on the screen, so keep is simple to people can use it easily.
            Ditch labels, have them displayed within the field. Increase field height. Float labels prevent confusion.
            Reduce field number, increase checkbox size. Only ask for information based on how they want to be contacted. 
            Paginate forms, break them into sections, and include a progress indicator. Enable auto complete. 
            Show passwords by default but allow users to hide easily.
            Pay attention to which keyboard is easier on your user.
            
            Advertising
            End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Pay attention to how people respond to technology.
            The pop-up is one of the most detested things on the web outside of auto-play video and audio.
            Make ads small and simple.
            Ad can grow upon click.
            Video ads usually result in higher conversion rates.
            Window in between content reveals full ad.
            Users don’t visit your site to look at ads. Use ads sparingly. Keep it simple and sleek. Make sure it’s unobtrusive. CONTENT FIRST!
            Q: We know pop ups annoy us….so why are they still used? Lack of continuing education for coders?
